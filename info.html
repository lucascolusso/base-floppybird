    After that, participants answer a series of questions about their personal beliefs in executing tasks and how they compare to others, along with demographics and personality surveys. All responses are confidential, and in no case will responses from individual participants be identified. All data will be pooled and published in aggregate form only. The study involves no more than minimal risk to participants (i.e., the level of risk encountered in daily life). Many individuals find participation in this study enjoyable, and no adverse reactions have been reported. Participation is voluntary, refusal to take part in the study involves no penalty or loss of benefits to which participants are otherwise entitled.
